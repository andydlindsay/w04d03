### What is AJAX?

**A**synchronous **J**avaScript **A**nd **X**ML

Invented by Microsoft for Outlook Web Access as a way of replicating desktop application functionality in the browser

Thanks to AJAX, web applications can send and receive data asynchronously without requiring a browser refresh

The widespread use of AJAX was one of the factors that led to Web 2.0

Originally retrieved data sent using `XML`, but modern applications use `JSON` instead

### XMLHttpRequest Object

AJAX is implemented using the `XMLHttpRequest` (`XHR`) object

Modern libraries (such as `jQuery` or `axios`) provide us with easy-to-use wrappers for the `XHR` object

### jQuery AJAX Example

```js
$.ajax({
    url: 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts',
    method: 'GET',
    dataType: "json",
    success: (data) => {
        console.log('this request succeeded and here\'s the data', data);
    },
    error: (error) => {
        console.log('this request failed and this was the error', error);
    }
});
```
